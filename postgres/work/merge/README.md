# MERGE Command in PostgreSQL

MERGE â€” conditionally insert, update, or delete rows of a table

PostgreSQL 15 introduced the MERGE statement that simplifies data manipulation by combining INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations into a single statement. The MERGE statement is often referred to as UPSERT statement.
